# Advanced Sql Techniques for Data Engineering

Project for IBM Data Engineering Sertificate.

I was given 3 csv's for data which will be included in the files with all of the sql queries made.

The project is done on IBM DB2 on cloud.


<b> - Exercise 1 Joins</b>

Question 1:

Write and execute a SQL query to list the school names, community names and average attendance for communities
with a hardship index of 98.

Question 2:

Write and execute a SQL query to list all crimes that took place at a school. Include case number, crime type and
community name.

<b> - Exercise 2 Views</b>

Question 1:

Write and execute a SQL statement to create a view showing the columns listed in the following table, with new column names as shown in the second column.

<b> - Exercise 3 Stored Procedure</b>

Question 1:

Write the structure of a query to create or replace a stored procedure called UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE that takes
a in_School_ID parameter as an integer and a in_Leader_Score parameter as an integer. Donâ€™t forget to use the #SET
TERMINATOR statement to use the @ for the CREATE statement terminator.

Question 2:

Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL statement to update the Leaders_Score field in the
CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID to the value in the
in_Leader_Score parameter.

Question 3:

Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL IF statement to update the Leaders_Icon field in the
CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID using the following information.

Question 4:

Run your code to create the stored procedure.

<b> - Exercise 4 Transactions</b>

Question 1:
Update your stored procedure definition. Add a generic ELSE clause to the IF statement that rolls back the current
work if the score did not fit any of the preceding categories.

![EX4Q1](https://github.com/KarlJosephKumar/AdvancedSqlTechniques/assets/41339304/0374f4ad-ada0-4551-a269-0231585ee32e)


Question 2:
Update your stored procedure definition again. Add a statement to commit the current unit of work at the end of the
procedure.
