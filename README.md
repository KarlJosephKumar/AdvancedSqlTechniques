## Summary
Project for IBM Data Engineering Certificate.

I was given 3 csv's for data which will be included in the files with all of the sql queries made.

The project is done on IBM DB2 on cloud.

<b> - Exercise 3 Stored Procedure</b>

Question 1:

Write the structure of a query to create or replace a stored procedure called UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE that takes
a in_School_ID parameter as an integer and a in_Leader_Score parameter as an integer. Donâ€™t forget to use the #SET
TERMINATOR statement to use the @ for the CREATE statement terminator.

![EX3Q1](https://github.com/KarlJosephKumar/AdvancedSqlTechniques/assets/41339304/cba1a9f1-6eef-44f1-97db-4109553db941)

Question 2:

Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL statement to update the Leaders_Score field in the
CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID to the value in the
in_Leader_Score parameter.

Question 3:

Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL IF statement to update the Leaders_Icon field in the
CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID using the following information.

Question 4:

Run your code to create the stored procedure.

<b> - Exercise 4 Transactions</b>

Question 1:
Update your stored procedure definition. Add a generic ELSE clause to the IF statement that rolls back the current
work if the score did not fit any of the preceding categories.

![EX4Q1](https://github.com/KarlJosephKumar/AdvancedSqlTechniques/assets/41339304/068bc4af-50fd-4196-a4d5-491997e94dd3)


Question 2:
Update your stored procedure definition again. Add a statement to commit the current unit of work at the end of the
procedure.
